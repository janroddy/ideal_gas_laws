 <h2>Variables in the Ideal Gas Law equation</h2>

 <ul>
  <li>P - pressure - pascals (atm)</li>
  <li>V - volume - liters (L)</li>
  <li>P - pressure - pascals (atm)</li>
  <li>P - pressure - pascals (atm)</li>
 </ul> 

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>only applies under ideal conditions</li>
    <li>deviates from reality at low temperatures, high pressures, or high density</li>
    <li>doesn't account for volume or attraction of particles</li>
  </ul>



       

<h2>Use the ideal gas law to solve the following problems:</h2>
<p>1.  If I have 4 moles of a gas at a pressure of 5.6 atm and a volume of 12 liters, what is the temperature?</p>  


     
     

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>On lines 4, 5, and 6 fill in the variables that correspond to a, b and c.</li>
    <li>On lines 8 and 9 use the table of operators and formula provided above to program the quadratic formula for the two solutions.  Don't forget parenthesis!</li>
    <li>Run the cell to see the output.</li>
    <li>Are these solutions real or imaginary?</li>
    <li>Change the two spots where you have "math.sqrt(b**2)" to "cmath.sqrt(b**2)" and rerun the cell.  How does this change the output?</li>
    <li>The cmath module provides access to complex numbers and when calling cmath.sqrt() the solution will include both the real and imaginary part of the number.</li>
